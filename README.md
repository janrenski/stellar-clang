# backtick
Backtick is a general purpose programming language that is currently in development.
It focuses on being C-like while not requiring anyone to use pointers and dynamic memory allocation.

Milestones:
- Make a somewhat working tokenizer which supports comments and floating point numbers which doesn't leak memory [Done]
- Make a parser which doesn't leak memory
- Compile a "Hello, World!" program
- Compile a bunch of example files (with the complete compiler supporting every operation) and run them
