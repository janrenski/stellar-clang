# Stellar C
Stellar C (formerly backtick-lang) AKA stellar-clang is a general purpose programming language that is currently in development.

The main objective of the project is to develop a stable, multi-paradigm
language with C-like syntax and performance which does all the hard things for you.
Kinda like Rust but also C and stuff.

Roadmap:

# Version 0.5
- [ ] Number variables and functions
- [ ] Arithmetic
- [ ] print and println statements
- [ ] if and else

# Version 1
- [ ] strings (variables, concatenation, etc.)
- [ ] modules and import
- [ ] switch statement
- [ ] for, while, foreach
- [ ] lists, arrays
- [ ] throw, catch, finally
- [ ] break, continue
- [ ] character support (got delayed because of difficulty with escape codes)
- [ ] objects, classes
- [ ] assembly system calls as functions
- [ ] standard library
- [ ] perhaps multiline comments?
- [ ] macros (like C's #define)?
- [ ] functions
